API DAY 3

	REQUEST --> Client sent request 

		- HTTP METHODS --> GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE  ......(There is more but we dont care)
		- API DOC 	
				- BASE URL  --> The part of the URL which same for all request/endpoint
					Ex-> {{spartanURL}}
				- ENDPOINTS --> Specific resource
					Ex-> {{spartanURL}}/api/spartans

			Where we need to get these infos ?
				- Each application has their own swagger/website/pdf doc .....
				- Just follow document to sent request 
				- API Dev will prepare it 
				- If there is no doc 
					- Ask developers
					- Team Mates 
					- Do Knowledge Tranfer Meeting to get info 


		- HEADER --> Additional information.It is KEY=VALUE format		


			- Accept , application/json --> Hey API Please send me resposne in application/json		
			- Accept , application/xml --> Hey API Please send me resposne in application/xml

			- Credentials --> We are gona talk later on 


		- PARAMETERS --> used to filter response 

			- Path Param --> It is part of URL.We are gonna to get single resource  
					
				Ex 1 -> {{spartanURL}}/endpoint/{id}
					 {id} --> it is path param 

				Ex 2 -> {{spartanURL}}/endpoint/{id}/endpoint/{id}
					 {id} --> it is path param 	 

				-> with the help of putting : it will appear in POSTMAN as Path Variables 


			- Query Param --> It is NOT part of URL.We are gonna use to filter resource 
				
				Ex 1 -> {{apiURL}}/endpoint?param1=value1&param2=value2

					param1 and param2 are query params keys
					value1 and value2 are values of these parameters

					? --> end of the URL and query params starting 
					& --> seperator between key and values 


		- BODY/PAYLOAD --> We are touch this later on (PUT - POST - PATCH )


	RESPONSE --> 

		- STATUS CODE --> indicate status of response (success or failure)

			- First thing that you need to check after getting response 

				- Getting 200 or any other expected status code does not guarantee the payload has expected data 

			- 2** --> Success
					  200 --> Success 
			- 4** --> Client Error
					  404 --> Not Found --> The request resource is not found 
					  406 --> Not acceptable --> While we are getting spesific spartan if you wanna get response as xml for 	format.It will not accept this request from client and return 406 Not acceptable 

			- 5** --> Server Side issues 	


	    - HEADER --> Additonal information 

	    	Content Type , application/json --> Hey Client I am sending data in application/json format	
	    	Content Type , application/xml --> Hey Client I am sending data in application/xml format	

	    	Date --> Just verify to see it is exist 
	    			response.headers().hasHeaderWithName("Date") --> return type is boolean
	    	Content-Length	
	    	......
	    	.....
	    	....
	    	...
	    	..
	    	.

	     - Response BODY / PAYLOAD 
	     
	        - CONTAINS --> NOT SUGGESTED - DOES NOT MAKE GUARANTEE 

	        	{
	        		"id":4,
	        		"name":"Fidole",
	        		"phone":12346789

	        	}

	        	response.body().asString() --> String	
	        	response.body().asString().contains("Fidole") --> it will return boolean 
========================================
HOW TO READ DATA FROM JSON RESPONSE TO MAKE VERIFICATION
1.We have learnt the containt method which is not good.


	        - CONTAINS --> NOT SUGGESTED - DOES NOT MAKE GUARANTEE 

	        	{
	        		"id":4,
	        		"name":"Fidole",
	        		"phone":12346789

	        	}

2.Path() method 

Response response = get("/api/spartans/1")

   {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Meade",
        "gender": "Male",
        "phone": 3584128232
   }

 
 response.path("id") --> 1
 response.path("name") --> Meade
 response.path("gender") --> Male
 response.path("phone") --> 3584128232

 response.path("jsonKeyname") it will return value that is stored in relative key.
