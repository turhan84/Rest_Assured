========================================
HOW TO READ DATA FROM JSON RESPONSE TO MAKE VERIFICATION
1.We have learnt the containt method which is not good.


	        - CONTAINS --> NOT SUGGESTED - DOES NOT MAKE GUARANTEE 

	        	{
	        		"id":4,
	        		"name":"Fidole",
	        		"phone":12346789

	        	}

2.Path() method 

Response response = get("/api/spartans/1")

   {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Meade",
        "gender": "Male",
        "phone": 3584128232
   }

 
 response.path("id") --> 1
 response.path("name") --> Meade
 response.path("gender") --> Male
 response.path("phone") --> 3584128232

 response.path("jsonKeyname") it will return value that is stored in relative key.

=================
GPATH -> It is the syntax to get specific data from JSON
      -Gpath is a path experssion language integrated into Groovy which allows parts of nested structured data to be identified.

      detail documentation --> http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#_gpath
================
2.JsonPath method 
   --there is no differene about using Gpaath synta with path(method)
   --It is similar way with path() method to navigate into JSON response.
   --It has couple of methods to make it readable and return requeired type of data directly.

         -getString
         -getInt
         -getLong
         -getList
         -getObject

 How does it work ? 

 items.findAll {it.region_id==2}.country_name

 items --> it is key for the array that we are getting from response.

      .findAll --> it is method that comes from Gpath to find all matching data

         {it.region_id==2} --> this is the condition that we are looking for to filter

               it-> iterator --> it will check each element from the array

                  .country_name --> data that we are looking for. 

                after filter array of Json Object will prepare list of data based on your return type.
